        { "q": "Do I need technical knowledge?", "a": "No. You upload a photo, optionally write a short note — everything else happens automatically. No coding, no setup, no hassle." },
        { "q": "Which platforms are included in which plan?", "a": "Starter (€39/month): up to 3 platforms of your choice (e.g. Instagram, TikTok, Facebook). Growth (€79/month): up to 6 platforms. Pro (€149/month): all 9 platforms at once (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn, X, YouTube and more). You can upgrade anytime." },
        { "q": "Do I have to plan when posts go out?", "a": "No. The system handles that automatically. You upload photos — the Auto-Scheduler controls when, how often, and on which platforms posts go out. You never have to touch the calendar." },
        { "q": "Can I cancel?", "a": "Yes, anytime. Monthly plans can be cancelled without notice. Yearly plans run for 12 months and renew automatically — you can cancel anytime before the renewal date." },
        { "q": "Can I switch my plan?", "a": "Yes. Upgrade from Starter to Growth or Pro anytime — you only pay the difference. Downgrade is possible at the next billing cycle." },
        { "q": "Does the AI also write in English or other languages?", "a": "Yes. The AI writes in any language — German, English, Turkish, Arabic and more. Just specify during setup." },
        { "q": "What is the launch offer?", "a": "The first 50 customers pay no setup fee — normally €99. The offer is valid until all 50 spots are taken, then we return to the regular price." },
        { "q": "Do scheduled posts perform as well as manual ones?", "a": "Yes. Scheduled posts perform just as well as manually published ones. Modern algorithms evaluate the relevance and quality of content — not whether someone manually clicked \"Post\". Consistency is actually an advantage." },
        { "q": "Is this safe for my social media accounts?", "a": "Yes. We exclusively use the official, verified APIs from Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and others — no scraping, no bots, no workarounds. Your accounts are 100% protected." },
        { "q": "How much time do I really save?", "a": "Our users report up to 90% time savings compared to manual posting across multiple platforms. Instead of 2–4 hours per week: upload a photo, done." }
